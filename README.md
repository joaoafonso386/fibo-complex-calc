# Complex Fibonacci Calculator Docker/EB

This is a complex implementation of a fibonacci sequence calculator.

The goal is to use services like redis and postgres to then have a bit more of a real world infrastructure to manage.

The code is not the relevant thing here, instead, the idea is to use docker (compose) and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.
